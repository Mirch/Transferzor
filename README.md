# Transferzor
This is a file transfer web application made in Blazor, as part of the series that you can read [on my blog](https://mirceaoprea.net/blog/file-transfer-app-with-blazor-introduction/).

The application is used to upload files from a user's computer to Amazon S3, and then send an email to another user with a download link.
It covers integrations with several Amazon services, as well as some basic Blazor development principles.
